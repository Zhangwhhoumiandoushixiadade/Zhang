  <summary><b> ✨ About Me</b></summary>

#### 👋 Hi there!

I'm a research graduate specializing in **medical image analysis**. When I'm not debugging neural networks or fine-tuning hyperparameters, you'll find me at the gym hitting my fitness goals. Coding, fitness, and coffee power my everyday life.  

**What I do during the day**:  
- Developing innovative deep learning models for medical imaging tasks.  
- Crafting efficient, elegant solutions for complex problems in AI and beyond.  

**What I enjoy in my free time**:  
- Building side projects that combine tech and creativity.  
- Creating Vlogs about fitness, coding, and the journey of personal growth.

#### 🏋️ My Life Motto:  
*"A strong body supports a focused mind."*
